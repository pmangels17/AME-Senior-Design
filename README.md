# AME-Senior-Design

GitHub for code for AME Senior Design.

Repository is public because ain't nobody got money for that, but it works basically like GrabCAD.  Use it to push
versions of code up to and down from the cloud, so we can be on the same page.  I find that applications lke this are
easier than just Google Drive for things like code and CAD.
